## üìä Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

### PostgreSQL Scalability Analysis

**Storage Requirements:**

-   **Flight Instances**: ~500KB per airline per day (assuming 100 flights/day)
-   **Bookings**: ~1KB per booking
-   **Events**: ~200 bytes per event (3-5 events per booking)

**For 1 million bookings/month:**

-   Storage: ~1.2GB/month
-   Read QPS: ~500-1000 (route searches)
-   Write QPS: ~100-200 (bookings + events)

**PostgreSQL can handle:**

-   10,000+ reads/second on modern hardware
-   1,000+ writes/second with proper indexing
-   Multi-TB databases with partitioning

**Our system is designed to scale horizontally with:**

-   Read replicas for route searches
-   Connection pooling
-   Redis caching (90%+ cache hit rate expected)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Route Search Algorithm

The `/api/routes` endpoint implements a sophisticated flight search algorithm:

1. **Direct Flight Search**: Queries flight instances for direct routes
2. **Transit Route Discovery**:
    - Validates transit routes from the routes configuration table
    - Finds connecting flights with proper layover timing
    - Calculates total journey and layover durations
3. **Intelligent Caching**:
    - Dynamic TTL based on departure proximity
    - 5 minutes for same-day flights
    - 30 minutes for weekly flights
    - 1 hour for future dates

### Event-Driven Architecture

The system uses an **events table** to track the complete lifecycle of bookings:

```sql
-- Events table captures all booking state changes
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  entity_type event_entity NOT NULL,  -- 'BOOKING'
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,            -- booking.id
  event_type event_type NOT NULL,     -- 'BOOKED', 'DEPARTED', 'ARRIVED', etc.
  location VARCHAR(3),                -- Airport code
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Benefits:**

-   **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all booking operations
-   **State Reconstruction**: Can rebuild booking status from events
-   **Analytics**: Rich data for operational insights
-   **Compliance**: Immutable record for regulatory requirements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rnkp755/air-cargo-booking.git
cd air-cargo-booking
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the environment example and configure your databases:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your database credentials:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/air_cargo
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Database Setup

Push the database schema and seed with sample data:

```bash
# Push database schema to PostgreSQL
pnpm drizzle-push

# Seed database with airports, routes, and flight instances
pnpm seed-db
```

The seeding process will create:

-   **Major airports** (DEL, DXB, BOM, BLR, etc.)
-   **Direct and transit routes** between airports
-   **Flight schedules** for multiple airlines
-   **Flight instances** for the next 30 days

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`

## üß™ Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
pnpm test:run

# Run only API integration tests
pnpm test:api
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

-   **Route Search Tests**: Validates route discovery algorithm
-   **Booking Creation**: Tests direct and transit route bookings
-   **Lifecycle Management**: Complete booking flow (BOOKED ‚Üí DEPARTED ‚Üí ARRIVED)
-   **Error Handling**: Invalid input and edge case validation
-   **Event Timeline**: Verifies proper event logging

### Test Data Requirements

Tests require seeded data. Ensure you've run:

```bash
pnpm seed-db
```

The tests will:

1. Search for routes between DEL and DXB
2. Create multiple booking types
3. Test complete booking lifecycle
4. Validate event timeline accuracy

## üè≠ Production Considerations

### Database Optimization

-   **Indexes**: Configured on frequently queried columns
-   **Partitioning**: Events table can be partitioned by date
-   **Connection Pooling**: Use PgBouncer for production

### Caching Strategy

-   **Route Cache**: 90%+ hit rate expected for popular routes
-   **TTL Management**: Dynamic based on departure proximity
-   **Cache Warming**: Pre-populate popular routes

### Monitoring & Observability

-   **Event Logging**: All booking operations logged
-   **Performance Metrics**: Response times and cache hit rates
-   **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error handling

### Security

-   **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API inputs
-   **SQL Injection**: Drizzle ORM provides parameterized queries
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implement for production deployment
